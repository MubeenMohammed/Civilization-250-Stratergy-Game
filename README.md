# Civilization-250-Stratergy-Game
If you want to play this game then download all the files from the Civilization250 folder and make a new folder name Civilization250 in your pc and paste all your files there. You will also need to create a new java file with any name you want and add the main method to run the code.
I would to love have someone look over the files and add the front end for the back end code that I have done.
